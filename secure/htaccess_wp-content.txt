Wp-contents is the folder in your WordPress directory that contains files of your themes, plugins,
media and cached files. Thatâ€™s why this directory is the main target for hackers and spammers.
Create a separate .htaccess file. Copy and paste the snippet below, in that file.

# Protect /wp-content Directory
# Allow Only Selected Files from /wp-content Directory
Order deny,allow
Deny from all
# Other MIME types (xml|css|js|jpe?g|png|gif|pdf|docx|rtf|odf|zip|rar)
<Files ~ ".(css|js|jpe?g|png|gif|)$">
    Allow from all
</Files>
